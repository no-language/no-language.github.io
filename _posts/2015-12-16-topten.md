### Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & Lowell
> The only reason why I continue at all: <br/>
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb

### Protomartyr - The Agent Intellect
> You dedicated your life to prayer <br/>
You suffered in silence there <br/>
That's not gonna save you, man

### Joanna Newsom - Divers
> So it would seem to be true: <br/>
When cruel birth debases, we forget <br/>
When cruel death debases, we believe <br/>
It erases all that preceded

### Craig Finn - Faith in the Future
> I was desperate to make a connection <br/>
I was from another planet, <br/>
It was very far away.

### Chvrches - Every Open Eye

You can keep me a trick of the light that you see

### The Mountain Goats - Beat the Champ
> Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street <br/>
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat <br/>
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike <br/>
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like

### Colin Stetson & Sarah Neufeld - Never Were the Way She Was

### Grimes - Art Angels

You gave up being good when you declared a state of WAR!
