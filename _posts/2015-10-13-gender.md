title: Gender parity in the 2015 Canadian federal election
---

There are 1,792 candidates from 25 political parties across 338 electoral districts participating in Canada's 2015 federal election. Of these candidates, 560, or 31.2%, are female.

The presence of women in elected positions isn't the only indicator that women are adequately represented in government, but it is a pretty important one. When the only way a party could be less inviting to women is by putting NO GIRLS ALLOWED on its campaign signs, it's hard to buy into the notion that they're going to do a good job of speaking for women once in power.

At a minimum, we would expect a party that treats men and women equally within its own ranks to advance male and female candidates for election in proportions that are at least in the neighbourhood of parity. This is especially true when there are a large number of candidates. However, it is far from the reality in the upcoming election.  

From the four largest national parties <sub><sup>(Conservative, Liberal, NDP, and Green, in case you haven't had coffee today)</sup></sub>, there are 1,350 candidates, 469 of whom (34.7%) are female.

In both the NDP and the Green Party, a 42% of candidates are female - not too bad. The Liberals fare worse by comparison, with about a third of their candidates being female. 

The Conservatives bring up the rear with an embarassingly low 21% of candidates being female. In absolute terms, the Conservatives have roughly half as many female candidates as the NDP and the Green Party, and a third as many as the Liberals.

In general, the provinces resemble each other pretty closely in terms of the proportion of female candidates, with women accounting for between 30 and 40 percent of candidates. Nova Scotia is a glaring exception, with only a fifth of candidates being female. 

I exclude the territories from the chart above, mainly to save space, but also because each comprises only one electoral district, making comparison with the provinces a little unfair (even PEI has four electoral districts). If you're curious, a quarter of candidates from the four major national parties in the Yukon and Nunavut are female, and there are no female candidates in the Northwest Territories. 

For the sake of completeness, I include plots of female representation broken down by party for each province. I exclude the territories, which only contain one electoral district apiece.
